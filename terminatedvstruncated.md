In the context of **OpenAI Gym** (or **Gymnasium**, the maintained fork), the terms **`truncated`** and **`terminated`** have distinct meanings when returned by an environment's `step()` function:

### 🧠 `terminated`

* **Meaning**: The episode **ended because the task was successfully completed or failed**.
* **Why**: It's based on the *environment's natural termination condition*, like winning a game or reaching a terminal state.
* **Example**: In CartPole, if the pole falls beyond a certain angle or the cart moves out of bounds.

### ⏱️ `truncated`

* **Meaning**: The episode was **cut short due to external constraints**, such as hitting a maximum number of steps.
* **Why**: It’s not because of success/failure in the task, but due to artificial limits (e.g., timeouts).
* **Example**: If you set a `TimeLimit` wrapper to end episodes after 200 steps, even if the pole hasn’t fallen.

### 🔁 Typical `step()` signature (Gymnasium style)

```python
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

### 🧪 When to use which

* Use `terminated` to check whether the task was **naturally** done.
* Use `truncated` to check whether it was **forcibly stopped**, like due to a step limit.

### ✅ Why this matters

It helps you:

* Properly evaluate agent performance (did it succeed or just run out of time?).
* Implement learning logic that distinguishes between task failure/success and timeout.
